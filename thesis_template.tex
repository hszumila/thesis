\chapter{Heavy Photon Search Experiment}
The Heavy Photon Search (HPS) experiment detector setup consists of a Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT) and an electromagnetic calorimeter (Ecal). The SVT, located inside of a dipole magnet, measures particle momentum and vertexes $e+e-$ pairs. The Ecal triggers the readout of physics events and measures particle energy and time. \par
The HPS experimental setup is located in the downstream alcove of Hall B at Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) produces an electron beam which passes through Hall B to the alcove where the beam interacts with the HPS target housed inside the pair spectrometer magnet with the SVT. This interaction yields particle pairs and beam scattered electrons which pass through the six layers of the SVT before depositing their energy in the Ecal for event readout.

\chapter{Detector Calibration and Performance} 

The first detector to be commissioned was the Ecal during preliminary running with a 2~GeV electron beam in Hall B in December 2014. The Ecal was initially calibrated prior to receiving any beam using cosmic energy deposition in the crystals. The Ecal demonstrated that all channels worked and the full readout using FADCs was useful for setting up the DAQ for future running. The SVT was installed in the early spring of 2015 and performed fully during the Engineering Run in the Spring 2015 at Jefferson Lab. The single pass beam energy was 1.056~GeV and was sufficient for not only detector commissioning but also calibration and physics analysis. 

\section{Silicon Vertex Tracker Performance}

(Include discussion on layer efficiency, 3 prong tracking efficiencies, moller mass, and fee peak.)

\subsection{Three particle event efficiencies}

\section{Electromagnetic Calorimeter Calibration}

The Ecal was calibrated both in energy and time. The first calibration performed, before receiving beam, was the cosmic ray energy calibration. A full timing calibration of the Ecal was also performed using the accelerator RF signal. A final calibration using physics events from elastically-scattered beam energy electrons and events from wide angle bremsstrahlung yielded the full calibration of the Ecal for all energies and characterized the energy resolution.
