\chapter{Motivation} 
The Standard Model (SM) is the most successful theory for describing elementary particles and their interactions via the electromagnetic, strong, and weak forces in terms of gauge theory interactions. The existence of an additional U(1) hidden symmetry is not forbidden by the SM and is well-motivated as a means to access physics beyond the standard model. The heavy photon is the proposed gauge boson mediator for the consequential dark electromagnetic force that would arise from a U(1) broken symmetry. Theory has predicted that if such an interaction exists, then the SM photon and heavy photon would mix thus inducing a coupling between the heavy photon and electric charge proportional to $\epsilon$~\cite{Holdom0}. This coupling is significant because electrons can radiate heavy photons through the same mechanism of radiating photons although at rates proportional to $\epsilon^2$. The primary goal of HPS and many similar experiments is to experimentally detect the heavy photon through this production mechanism. The heavy photon is additionally referred to as the A$^{\prime}$, dark photon, or U-boson.

\chapter{Heavy Photon Search Experiment}
The HPS experiment detector setup consists of the SVT and ECal. The SVT, located inside of a dipole magnet, measures particle momentum and vertexes $e+e-$ pairs. The ECal triggers the readout of physics events and measures particle energy and time. \par
The HPS experimental setup is located in the downstream alcove of Hall B at Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. CEBAF produces an electron beam which passes through Hall B to the alcove where the beam interacts with the HPS target housed inside the pair spectrometer magnet with the SVT. This interaction yields particle pairs and beam scattered electrons which pass through the six layers of the SVT before depositing their energy in the ECal for event readout.

\chapter{Detector Calibration and Performance} 

The first detector to be commissioned was the ECal during preliminary running with a 2~GeV electron beam in Hall B in December 2014. The ECal was initially calibrated prior to receiving any beam using cosmic ray energy deposition in the crystals. The ECal demonstrated that all channels worked and that the full readout chain using FADC250 modules with the DAQ performed well. The SVT was installed in the early spring of 2015 and was fully commissioned during the Engineering Run. The single pass beam energy was 1.056~GeV and was sufficient for detector commissioning, calibration, and physics analysis. 

\section{Silicon Vertex Tracker Performance}

The SVT momentum calibration is primarily guided by the accuracy of the alignment in the magnetic field. Tracks on both top and bottom for elastically-scattered electrons should peak at the same beam energy at the same resolution. The Billoir vertexing algorithm is the method by which two tracks are re-fit to create a vertex. The invariant mass is reconstructed from the vertex of the two tracks. 

%\input{texFiles/DetectorPerformance/SVT/svt.tex}

(Include discussion on layer efficiency, 3 prong tracking efficiencies, moller mass, and fee peak resolution.)

\section{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}

The ECal was calibrated both in energy and time. The first calibration performed before receiving beam from the accelerator was the cosmic ray energy calibration. A full timing calibration of the ECal was also performed using the accelerator RF signal. A final calibration using physics events from elastically-scattered beam energy electrons and events from wide angle bremsstrahlung (WAB) yielded the full calibration of the ECal for all energies and characterized the energy resolution.

The following section consists of three different datasets used to measure a combined 0.5~mm reach. The 0.5~mm data was recorded during stable beam times when the SVT bias voltage was on, and the SVT layer 1 was positioned at $\pm$0.5~mm from the beam.

%\section{Cuts on SVT at 1.5 mm from the beam}

The 1.5~mm datasets consist of the data that was taken over approximately 0.5~beam days with the first layer of the SVT at 1.5~mm from the beam. Because this run was the engineering run, the beam position and stability had to the be fully understood before moving the SVT in to its nominal position at 0.5~mm from the beam.
