Background events can be produced from QED trident processes and wide-angle bremsstrahlung (WAB). The trident processes can be separated into "radiative" and "Bethe-Heitler" diagrams. In particular, the heavy photon production is related to the radiative trident cross section. The A' production for a mass bin is described as shown in Equation~\eqref{eq:crossSection}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:crossSection}
\dfrac{d\sigma(A'\rightarrow e+e-)}{d\sigma(\gamma*\rightarrow e+e-)} = \left(\dfrac{3\pi\epsilon^{2}}{2N_{eff}\alpha}\right)\left(\dfrac{m_{A'}}{\delta m_{A'}}\right)
\end{equation}

In Equation~\eqref{eq:crossSection}, $N_{eff}$, the number of available decay states, is one for the HPS experiment which explores a mass range in which the heavy photon can only decay to one Standard Model final state ($e+e-$). The $\epsilon^{2}$ refers to the coupling factor between the heavy photon and the Standard Model while the $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant. The $\dfrac{m_{A'}}{\delta_{m_{A'}}}$ refers to the central mass value considered in the mass bin of study. The fraction of radiative reactions amongst trident events in the HPS search region is the radiative fraction. Using MadGraph5 Monte Carlo to model the tridents and radiatives and MadGraph4 Monte Carlo to model the wide angle bremsstrahlung (WAB) background, the radiative fraction can be determined as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:radFrac}.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:radFrac}, the radiative fraction relevant to the vertex analysis is approximately 9.5$\%$ for all masses. This fraction is defined as the ratio of radiative events to the background events (tritrig+WAB in Figure~\ref{fig:radFrac}) and is the same for both the 0.5~mm and 1.5~mm data sets.
