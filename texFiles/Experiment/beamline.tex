The HPS experiment is installed in the downstream alcove of experimental Hall B at Jefferson Lab as shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:hallB}~\cite{beamline_nim_2017}. Due to the planned construction of the CLAS12 detector in Hall B as part of the 12~GeV upgrade, HPS running was planned for nights and weekends when running beam through the hall would not interfere with CLAS12 construction. After the failure of the second CHL, HPS received dedicated, continuous running during May of 2015 in support of the Engineering Run.

The tagger magnet as depicted in Fig.~\ref{Figure:hallB} was used for initial beam tuning from the accelerator before sending the beam through to the HPS detectors. By energizing the tagger magnet, the electron beam was visible at the tagger dump viewer and could be aligned at the center of the viewer. Harp scans were performed to measure the position and width of the beam spot after the beam appeared to be in reasonable alignment~\cite{beamline_nim_2017}. Once the harp scans showed the beam to be of an acceptable size and position upstream of HPS, the tagger magnet was de-gaussed for HPS running. Without the tagger magnet on, the electron beam enters the hall in vacuum and passes through the hall to the HPS setup as shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:hpsBeamline}.

The HPS setup consists of a three-dipole chicane with fields in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the Hall B floor. The target and the SVT are housed in the central magnet known as the pair spectrometer, or analyzing magnet. The pair spectrometer has a pole length of 91.44~cm and width of 45.72~cm. For 2.2~GeV electrons, the central magnetic field of the pair spectrometer magnet is 0.5~T~\cite{beamline_nim_2017}. For other beam energies, the analyzing magnet magnetic field is scaled accordingly. In the Engineering Run in May 2015, with a beam energy of 1.056~GeV, the pair spectrometer had a central field value of 0.24~T. The Frascati magnets, one on each side of the analyzing magnet, have magnetic fields opposite to that of the analyzing magnet such that the integrated field value over the length of the pole value of each Frascati is half of the integrated field value of the analyzing magnet. This ensures that the beam will end at the same location whether the chicane is energized or not and that the trajectory of beam energy electrons in the magnetic field is consistent across different beam energies. The magnetic field of the HPS beam line in the chicane is shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:bField}.

\end{figure}

The trajectory and position of particles inside the magnetic field was studied using magetic field mappings from experimentally obtained measurements that included fringe field effects. The positions of the pair spectrometer magnet with respect to the Frascati magnets was determined from these field mappings. The horizontal trajectory of a beam energy electron as affected by the magnetic field is shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:trajectory}.

  \label{Figure:trajectory}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{Figure:trajectory}, the target position is where the $z$ position is zero. The entry angle at the target was also studied and determined to be approximately 30.5~mrad. At 70~cm from the target, the pair spectrometer magnet and vacuum chamber are centered on the position of the photon trajectory from the target such that the photons pass unobstructed through all subsequent vacuum chambers. The pair spectrometer magnet was placed 8.87~cm beam left, thus placing the HPS target position 2.14~cm to the right of the magnet center line. By modeling the vacuum chambers and magnetic fields in the GEant4 Monte Carlo (GEMC) framework, the particle trajectories through the HPS beam line can be observed as in Fig.~\ref{Figure:gemc}.

  \label{Figure:gemc}
\end{figure}
 
As shown in ~\ref{Figure:gemc}, the beam energy electrons clearly pass through the exit hole of the last vacuum chamber (contained in the second Frascati dipole) and continue traveling to the Faraday cup where the beam charge can be measured. The beam line was modeled in GEMC and, in real running, utilized a multitude of monitors to ensure clear passage of the beam.

The passage of the beam through the HPS beam line was monitored using beam position monitors (BPMs), wire scans with halo counters, beam viewers, and a Faraday cup. The three upstream nA BPMs give continuous beam current and position readings. These BPMs can indicate that the beam is scraping the beam pipe when the current readings are fluctuate and differ with respect to each other. The current readings from the BPMs were compared to the current reading at the Faraday Cup (located downstream of the HPS beam line at the dump). When the beam current is at 50~nA or below, the reading at the Faraday Cup current is roughly the same as the current read out by the upstream BPMs and indicates no beam scraping in the beam pipe. When operating at currents above 50~nA, it was standard to insert a beam blocker in front of the Faraday Cup in order to protect it. The beam stopper would then create an offset in the Faraday Cup current readout and the actual beam current. Additionally, a viewer screen at the Faraday Cup was used to show the beam position. HPS used a florescent screen that showed the position of the beam by emitting light at the particular point where the beam passed on the screen. A video camera streaming a view of the screen was used for remotely observing the relative beam position on the screen.  

Harp scans measure the current and position of the beam through interaction with the beam (as compared to the passive, continuous readout employed through the BPMs). A harp scan moves wires through the beam vertically, horizontally, and diagonally while  downstream halo counters measure the scattered beam electron spray. The halo counters are photomultiplier tubes (PMT) strapped around the beam pipe line. The intensity of the electron spray detected by the PMTs is proportional to the beam charge that the wire interacts with. A typical harp scan from the Engineering Run is shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:harpScan}.

  \label{Figure:harpScan}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{Figure:harpScan}, the beam profile is characteristically narrower in $y$ (vertically) than in $x$ (horizontally). The proposed beam profile for the HPS experiment was 50~$\mu$m in $y$ and 300~$\mu$m in $x$ in order to prevent overheating at the target and allow for precise vertex reconstruction. While overheating was not a limiting factor in the experiment, most of the 2015 running had a beam profile of no larger than 50~$\mu$m in $y$ and 150~$\mu$m in $x$. 

\subsection{Target}

The primary HPS target is a thin tungsten foil that is mounted on a support frame having the capability to be fully retracted from the beam when not in use. For proposed 1.1~GeV and 2.2~GeV running, the design thickness of the target tungsten foil is 0.125$\%$ radiation lengths (approximately 4~$\mu$m of tungsten). The measured thickness of the actual target was 0.116$\%$. Mounted on the same frame is a tungsten target of 0.25$\%$ radiation lengths for future running at 4.4~GeV and 6.6~GeV. The target support frame inserts the foil target from above the beam using a stepping motor linear actuator. By necessity, the bottom of the target foil is free-standing so that the target can be inserted into the active beam without interruption.  

\subsection{Collimator}

A collimator is used in the HPS beamline in order to protect the silicon strips of the SVT detector in the event of the beam moving vertically from its nominal position. The collimator is a 1~cm thick tungsten plate with different sized holes through which the beam can pass. Should the beam drift vertically from its nominal position, the collimator would be able to absorb the beam and protect the silicon before the machine fast shutdown (FSD) would be triggered by excess counts in the beam halo counters. For the 2015 run, the 4~mm collimator hole was used.
