The HPS experiment sends an electron beam onto a thin tungsten target and looks for radiated heavy photons in the reconstructed $e^+e^-$ mass spectrum. HPS looks for heavy photons in the range of 20 to 1000~MeV/c$^2$ and covers this territory with two searches on the same dataset that probe different heavy photon coupling regimes. A bump hunt searches for the heavy photon signal as a resonance on a large background. The bump hunt looks for heavy photons with large couplings and decay at the target. The vertex search looks for heavy photons that have detached vertices, having a measurable lifetime and decaying downstream of the target. 

\subsection{Signal}

The heavy photon is generated from the electron beam interaction with a heavy target as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:apTree} where $Z$ is the atomic number corresponding to the target material.

   	 \label{fig:apTree}	
\end{figure}

Shown for the HPS experiment, the heavy photon decays to $e^+e^-$ pairs with a measurable mass and possible displaced vertex downstream from the target. The differential cross section for heavy photon production is 

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:apDiffCS}
	\dfrac{d\sigma}{dxd\cos\theta_{A^{\prime}}} \approx \dfrac{8Z^2\alpha^3\epsilon^2E_0^2x}{U(x,\theta_{A^{\prime}})^2}\log\Big( (1-x+\dfrac{x^2}{2})-\dfrac{x(1-x)m_{A^{\prime}}^2E_0^2x\theta_{A^{\prime}}^2}{U(x,\theta_{A^{\prime}})^2}\Big)
\end{equation}

where $Z$ is the atomic number of the target material, $\alpha$ is the usual fine structure constant, $\theta_{A^{\prime}}$ is the lab frame angular difference between the incoming electron and outgoing heavy photon, $E_0$ is the electron incident energy, $m_{A^{\prime}}$ is the heavy photon mass, and the fraction of incident beam energy carried by the the heavy photon $x\equiv E_{A^{\prime}}/E_0$~\cite{bjorken_new_2009}. The virtuality of the intermediate electron is described by

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:virtuality}
	U(x,\theta_{A^{\prime}}) = E_0^2x\theta_{A^{\prime}}^2+m_{A^{\prime}}^2\dfrac{1-x}{x}+m_e^2x 
\end{equation}

where $m_e$ is the mass of the electron. The cross section is further simplified for $m_e\ll m_{A^{\prime}}\ll E_0$ and $x\theta_{A^{\prime}}^2\ll 1$. Integrating Equation~\eqref{eq:apDiffCS} over the angle, the cross section is

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:csFinal}
	\dfrac{d\sigma}{dx} \approx \dfrac{8Z^2\alpha^3\epsilon^2x}{m_{A^{\prime}}^2}\Big(1+\dfrac{x^2}{3(1-x)}\Big)
\end{equation}

The total heavy photon production rate is proportional to $\alpha^3\epsilon^2/m_{A^{\prime}}^2$ and is suppressed relative to photon bremsstrahlung by $\epsilon^2m_e^2/m_{A^{\prime}}^2$.The singularity is regulated by the mass of the electron and cutoff for values where $1-x$ exceeds $m_e^2/m_{A^{\prime}}^2$ or $m_{A^{\prime}}^2/E_0^2$. The heavy photon carries nearly the entire beam energy such that the median value of $1-x\sim\textrm{max}\Big(\dfrac{m_e}{m_{A^{\prime}}}, \dfrac{m_{A^{\prime}}}{E_0}\Big)$. The heavy photon is emitted predominately at small angles with a cutoff at $\dfrac{m_{A^{\prime}}^{3/2}}{E_0^{3/2}}$ such that the angular emission falls off as $1/\theta_{A^{\prime}}^4$.\\
 \indent The heavy photon is characterized by its mass (as reconstructed from the decay to $e^+e^-$) and decay length. Depending on the coupling strength $\epsilon$, the vertex may be reconstructed from a prompt decay at the target or a measurable decay downstream.  

\subsection{Backgrounds}

The primary backgrounds in this experiment include trident events and wide angle bremsstrahlung (WAB). The tridents have a three particle final state $e^-e^-e^+$ and are broadly categorized into radiative and Bethe-Heitler diagrams~\cite{bjorken_new_2009}. The trident events were the primary source of background considered prior to running the experiment. It was later found that WAB events contributed to the background with an $e^-\gamma$ final state where the photon pair produced an $e^+e^-$. In most cases, the event was triggered by the initial electron and pair-produced positron.

   	 \label{fig:radTree}	
\end{figure}

The radiative background is irreducible and comprises the smooth background upon which the bump hunt search for the heavy photon signal is conducted. The Bethe-Heitler tridents also contribute significantly to the background although they are peaked at lower $e^+e^-$ total energy. The Bethe-Heitler contribution is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bhTree}.

The radiative and Bethe-Heitler diagrams also interfere although this generally only contributes an $e^+e^-$ total energy sum much less than the beam energy.
