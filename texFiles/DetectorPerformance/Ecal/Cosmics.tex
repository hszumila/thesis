The large area APDs enabled the ECal to have the sensitivity to detect signals from cosmic muons traversing the ECal crystals perpendicularly. This signal was used for the initial calibration of the modules. The experimental setup was modeled using Monte Carlo simulations so that the energy deposited in the crystals from cosmic ray muons and rates could be studied. By measuring the average path length of cosmic ray muons in each crystal, the energy deposited in each crystal of the ECal was calculated using the known energy deposition from 2~GeV muons \cite{Agashe:2014kda}. 

The experimental setup for the cosmic calibrations used two scintillators placed below the ECal to trigger readout of all of the crystals. A schematic for the setup of the cosmic calibration is shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:cosmicScheme}.

%include some discussion of the improvement achieved after removing the splitters

Each scintillator measures 75~cm long, 22~cm wide and 5~cm thick covering a slightly larger perpendicular area than the ECal crystals. The two scintillators are less than half a meter apart with the closest scintillator less than half a meter beneath the ECal. The energy deposited in each crystal in a layer is sensitive to the path length of the track as it passed through the crystal. From simulation, the average energy deposited in a crystal by a cosmic ray passing vertically though the ECal is shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:cosmicEdep}.

  \label{Figure:cosmicEdep}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{Figure:cosmicEdep}, only tracks passing through one crystal in a row were included. Additinally, the cosmic ray muon track had to pass through an adjacent crystal in the row above and below a crystal. For crystals near edges, the geometrical requirement was adjusted to include the two crystals immediately above (or below for cases where the edge is above the crystal) the crystal being readout. The average energy deposited per crystal is approximately 18.3~MeV from the PDG. 

In data, the raw FADC waveform for each crystal is readout, and the event is kept for further study after applying strict coincidence cuts between the two scintillators. The trigger rate for data is about 7~Hz. 30$\%$ of events passed the coincidence cut between the scintillators. For a track passing vertically through all ten layers, we can see the signal in each crystal as shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:cosmicSig}.

  \label{Figure:cosmicSig}
\end{figure}

As seen in Fig.~\ref{Figure:cosmicSig}, each FADC channel has a unique pedestal value. The pedestal for each event was calculated as an average of the first twenty bins of the time window. By searching for a threshold crossing in the time window where cosmic events occurred, the signal was then fully integrated and the pedestal was subtracted. The raw waveform thresholds were 2.5~mV in 2015 and increased to 3.5~mV in 2016 to accommodate the larger signals after the removal of the splitters. Geometric cuts are then applied to the data in offline analysis. Crystals having peaks over a certain threshold must have at least an adjacent crystals located above and below with threshold crossing, but the crystals to the left and right must not cross threshold. These cuts ensure that that the track passed as vertically as possible through the ECal (reducing the variations in path length across each crystal). The integrated signals over many events in each crystal were fit. An individual crystal fit is shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:cosmicFit}.

  \caption[Integrated cosmic signal in ECal fitted for calibration]{Each cosmic signal was integrated and then fit using a Landau-Gaussian convolution function. The peak was calculated numerically from this fit.}
  \label{Figure:cosmicFit}
\end{figure}

The fit shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:cosmicFit} utilized a Landau-Gaussian convolution as the Landau part corresponds to the crystal's response to a particle's energy deposition as ionization energy loss, and the Gaussian part accounts for the statistical nature of the electronics shaping and readout. The peak of the fit is calculated numerically, and the initial conversion from units of FADC to energy (MeV) is obtained (called the Gain factor). The unit conversion from units mV to FADC is 1~V to 4096~FADC. The 4096~FADC counts can be set to 1~V or 2~V, but for 2015 and 2016 running, the setting was 1~V. This arises from the 12~bit conversion which yields 4096~FADC. The gain factor is calculated using the measured peak positioin in units of FADC and the known energy deposited from simulation in units of MeV as shown in Eqn.~\eqref{eq:gain}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:gain}
	Gain = \dfrac{[MeV]}{[FADC]} 
\end{equation}

After approximately 60~hours of cosmic data, the full ECal could be calibrated using cosmics, and the resultant gains for all channels in the Engineering Run is shown shown in Fig.~\ref{Figure:cosmicG} and Fig.~\ref{Figure:cosmicGhisto}.

\end{figure}

With the splitters installed in the ECal readout chain, the average gain value was around 0.2~MeV/FADC for the Engineering Run. After the removal of the splitters in January 2016, prior to the Physics Run, the average gains were found to be around 0.13~MeV/FADC.
